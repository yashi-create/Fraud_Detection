**Overview:**

The project leverages supervised learning to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Key steps include data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and prediction evaluation, using algorithms that enhance accuracy and minimize false positives.

**Dataset:**

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Description: The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.



**Models**
Various machine learning models are explored, such as:
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

Each model is fine-tuned to achieve the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.


**Evaluation Metrics**

Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly identified transactions.

Precision: Focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions (fraudulent transactions).

Recall: Captures how many actual fraudulent transactions were identified.

F1 Score: Balances precision and recall.
